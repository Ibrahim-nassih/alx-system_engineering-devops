Afterthought: The Funny 2024 API Meltdown

Problem Synopsis
The outage lasted for two hours, from June 10, 2024, from 14:00 to 16:00 UTC.
Impact: There was a GitHubStatsAPI outage. Users reported 100% API request failures and complete darkness. Imagine a coffee shop that runs out of coffeeâ€”chaos! Roughly 95% of our users were stuck, staring at their devices indifferently.
Root cause: After a regular upgrade, a clever misconfiguration occurred in the load balancer settings.
Timetable
14:00 UTC - ðŸš¨ Problem identified: Our overzealous monitoring system began yelling that there was a 100% failure rate in API queries.
Team reported at 14:05 UTC: PagerDuty sounded like a fire alarm. Slack messages shot out more quickly than a child chasing lollipops.
The investigation started at 14:10 UTC, and we immediately dug into the server and load balancer data.
14:20 UTC - Possible problem with the application server:Have you tried turning it off and on again? is a tried and true question. Nope, still not fixed.
At 14:40 UTC, we escalated the issue to a senior DevOps engineer, which is akin to contacting Batman.
14:50 UTC - Team DevOps: began experimenting with load balancer settings and network setups.
the eureka moment at 15:10 UTC: discovered the load balancer routing rules having fun in inappropriate places.
15:20 UTC - Pointless meandering: verified the settings of the API servers and database connections. Nothing.
15:30 UTC - The load balancer settings were corrected: Restarted the service and adjusted the rogue settings.
15:45 UTC - Restoring service: Monitoring verified the return of our API endpoints. Start the joyful dances.
16:00 UTC - Complete restoration of services: Stable monitoring with no problems. Problem solved!
The Cause and Solution
Root Cause: A bothersome load balancer configuration error following a standard update. The update subtly changed the routing rules, resulting in a complete failure of API requests by sending all incoming traffic to a digital void.

Resolution: The load balancer's settings were restored to their original state. The DevOps team restarted the load balancer ceremoniously after fixing the naughty routing rules. All right! Service has been resumed.

Improvements in Corrective and Preventive Measures:

Improved observation Pronto, more eyes on the load balancer.
Improved method of deployment: Extra safeguards, such as sobriety tests, are in place for load balancer changes.
Revised records: Completely safe documents with the right parameters and typical dangers.
ACTION TO DO:

Patch Load Balancer: Examine and implement updates to avert more configuration errors. No more deceptive adjustments.
Add Monitoring: Thorough monitoring for changes in load balancer setup and health. notifications of any deviations. instant alerts for mental tranquility.
Update Deployment Process: To ensure configurations are correct after an update, check the load balancer update checklist.
Should a problem be found, use the rollback technique to return to earlier configurations. Plenty of safety nets.
Documentation: Comprehensive instructions for setting up the load balancer.
Keep track of common problems and solutions. Power comes from knowledge.
Instruction: Workshops on improved deployment and monitoring procedures for the DevOps staff.
Make sure that everyone in the team is aware of the updated documents and practices. Together, we can realize the dream.
By fixing these issues, we hope to stop such situations from happening again and give our users a more dependable and resilient service. For nobody enjoys having their coffee business run out of coffee.
